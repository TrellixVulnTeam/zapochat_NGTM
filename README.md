# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Flack allows users to send text messages and images to each other in real time. When a user visits Flack, a dialog box pops up asking for the user's name if it is the user's first time visiting the site. When the user submits their display name, the display name is stored in local storage so the user does not have to re-input their display name upon visiting the site again. Users can send messages in different rooms in Flack. They can change their room with a dropdown/button at the top right corner. The dropdown displays all the rooms that have been created and the user can create/join a room by pressing the button. Users can send messages in rooms. When a user sends a message, it is displayed with their name and date/time sent, up to a hundred messages per room stored in server-side memory (though more can be seen on a client's page).
